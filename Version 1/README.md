Simple Keras model to predict market direction using the weekly changes of the US Federal Reserve, Treasury, and others.

## Disclaimer

This model is not intended to be used as an investment tool. 

## Requirements

install [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Download [model](model_v1.pkl) and [model_test](model_test.py)

install [Keras 2.3.1](https://keras.io/), [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/),[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), and [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
